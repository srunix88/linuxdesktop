Just notes in playing around with desktops

You might wonder why a Staff Systems Engineer at a fortune 100 company would be interested in playing around with a linux desktop. And frankly, I have stayed away from it for quite a while. But with the mode to more and more workloads being in the cloud, as well as the speed at which MAC OS causes hardware to be obsoleted or at least not supported, why wouldn't I want to find a user for my 2013 Macbook Pro, which is still very useful from a hardware perspective and likely will be for several more years.

In addition, as I am starting to study things like Hyperledger and blockchain which I can run on Linux easily as well in Docker containers, so why not run them on a dekstop.

And it is a nice way for others who have older hardware which is now very robust to try out linux. I've often wondered when a linux desktop would become functional from a desktop perspective - having dabbled with them over the last 15+ years... I figured it would be worth taking another look.

Linux Mint / Cinnamon is the one I am trying now. And it is okay. It's not quite a Mac... and I think the font sizes and icons expect a worse resolution that a retina display... 

As far as the apps I can install, I am starting to get very distracted with all the choices.

And since I ran upon Virtual Box, I started hacking around with it to see how easy or hard it was going to be to download ISO files and install multiple OS versions just to play around. And I am running out of space, so I have a bunch of external hard disks... so why not attach a physical disk drive via USB to the Virtual box... so how do I do that?

And I wanted to take notes, and I was planning to use all the various note tools, but decided, I would just use github for now. 
I see there is a note client for Evernote... that might be worth trying one day.

And once I download the ISO files... how do I burn them onto a USB stick or hard disk:
